      <h2>Introduction:</h2>
      <p>This case is presented as it was originally received and reported, several years ago … Clinical information. A lesion on the parietal scalp of a 28-year-old female. Reason for consultation. In a few areas, the lesion shows features which suggest to me that it may represent a cellular blue nevus. However, I am concerned about the possibility that it may represent a malignant blue nevus or malignant melanoma.</p>

      <h2>Pathological/Microscopic Findings and any Immunohistochemical or Other Studies:</h2>
      <p>This material is unusually difficult. The sections show a bulky melanocytic tumor, located in the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue. The tumor presents, in some areas, an organoid appearance, with nests and fascicles of spindle- shaped cells and, in some areas, with dendritic pigmented cells. These attributes are quite characteristic of cellular blue nevi. In other areas, however, there are broad sheets of less differentiated epithelioid melanocytes, showing significant though not striking nuclear atypia, with prominent nuclear line, and with easily detectable mitoses. In addition, there are a few abnormal mitoses. Although, as you point out, the lesion is reasonably well-circumscribed, in some areas it appears to have an infiltrative relationship with surrounding collagen and adipose tissue.</p>

      <p>There is no necrosis. </p>

      <p>Although I would place this lesion, for purposes of categorization, in the cellular blue nevus category, I cannot regard it as a benign lesion. The important features in reaching this conclusion are the extensive epithelioid cell areas, the moderate nuclear atypia, the occasional mitoses, the presence of abnormal mitoses, and the focally infiltrative pattern (with a couple of satellites) at the periphery. On the other hand, the lesion lacks necrosis, one of the most widely cited diagnostic criteria for so called "malignant blue nevus". Thus, for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, I would sign this is lesion out descriptively, as "dermal spindle and epithelioid cell melanocytic tumor, probably of low malignant potential".</p>

      <h2>Differential Diagnoses:</h2>
      <p>Atypical Cellular Blue Nevus vs. Malignant Blue Nevus.</p>

      <h2>Final Diagnosis:</h2>
      <p>Malignant Blue Nevus.</p>

      <h2>Case Discussion:</h2>
      <p>Diagnosis: Skin, parietal scalp: Dermal spindle and 
      epithelioid cell melanocytic tumor, probably of low 
      malignant potential</p>
      <p>Comment. Because of the organoid differentiation, I believe 
      that this lesion is certainly not a metastatic melanoma. 
      Furthermore, I do not believe that it is a characteristic 
      primary malignant melanoma, because of the absence of an in 
      situ component and the presence of background components of 
      cellular and banal blue nevus. It is possible that some 
      consultants might regard this lesion is a benign cellular 
      blue nevus. However, I believe that it may have at least a 
      potential for local recurrence, and possibly some low 
      potential for metastasis. As you know, cellular blue nevi 
      have been associated with metastases to regional lymph 
      nodes, followed by long survival. Thus, I would regard the 
      prognosis for this patient as excellent, provided that local 
      control is achieved, probably with a modest local 
      reexcision. I do not believe that a formal wide excision as 
      typically advocated for high-risk primary cutaneous melanoma 
      is indicated.</p>

      <p>Three Years Later. 
      Thank you for your letter with follow-up information and a 
      slide from the above captioned case. I have reviewed the 
      previous material in some detail. The slide shows a bulky 
      cutaneous tumor, with attributes of a cellular blue nevus, 
      namely the bottom heavy and somewhat "dumbbell" 
      configuration, the presence of nests of clear spindle cells 
      embedded in a background of eosinophilic cuboidal cells, and 
      the presence of associated dendritic heavily pigmented cells 
      in the reticular dermis reminiscent of common blue nevi. 
      There are no areas of necrosis, there is no high grade 
      nuclear atypia, and mitotic figures although readily 
      observed and not frequent. I counted approximately 2-3 
      mitotic figures per square millimeter in various areas of 
      the tumor. </p>

      <p>Approximately 3 years later, a liver biopsy demonstrated 
      metastatic pigmented tumor in the liver, consistent with 
      metastasis from this patient's lesion. 
      Figure 12. A section from a needle biopsy of the liver. At 
      the top left, there are benign liver cells. At the bottom 
      right, there is a pigment synthesizing tumor consistent with 
      a metastasis from the patient's primary lesion of the scalp.</p>

      <h2>Review of the Literature/Treatment Options:</h2>
      <p>Malignant blue nevus is a rare diagnosis, and only a few 
      substantial case series have been published over the last 
      several decades [<a href="#ref1"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref2"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref4"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref5"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref6"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref6">6</a>]. These lesions need to be 
      distinguished from common blue nevi, from cellular blue nevi 
      and atypical cellular blue nevi, and from melanoma. 
      Common blue nevi are generally small lesions that lack all 
      of the features of malignant blue nevi as discussed below. 
      The first use of the term “cellular blue nevus” to 
      distinguish these lesions from melanoma is attributed to 
      Allen in 1949 [<a href="#ref7"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref7">7</a>]. As recently reviewed by Zembowicz [<a href="#ref8"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref8">8</a>], 
      these lesions can occur at all ages and common locations 
      include the sacrococcygeal region and buttock, followed by 
      scalp, face and extremities, and a wide range of less common 
      locations. Clinically these lesions are firm bluish black to 
      bluish gray dome shaped nodules. Most are in the 1 to 2 cm 
      range, but a few may be much larger. Histologically these 
      lesions most commonly exhibit a “mixed-biphasic” pattern, 
      with pigmented spindle cell fascicles alternating with clear 
      epithelioid cells arranged in nests; the latter may be 
      characterized as an “alveolar” pattern. There may be areas 
      of a more uniform spindle cell pattern, which has been 
      termed “fascicular and neuronevoid” [<a href="#ref1"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref1">1</a>]. There is no 
      overlying junctional component. There is typically a 
      background banal blue nevus component. A common pattern is 
      that of a “dumbbell” where two separate masses in the dermis 
      and subcutis are joined by a narrow isthmus. Cytologically, 
      the nuclei tend to be relatively pale with regular nuclear 
      membranes, finally stippled chromatin, and inconspicuous 
      nucleoli. There is no severe uniform cytologic atypia or 
      necrosis. Mitotic figures are usually absent and in any case 
      should be sparse (e.g. less than one per square millimeter, 
      and only a few per lesion). </p>
      <p>Atypical cellular blue nevus has been described in a few 
      publications as a variant of cellular blue nevus. 
      Characteristics that have been used in establishing these 
      diagnoses have included larger size, ulceration, cytologic 
      atypia, and increased mitotic activity. In a recent study of 
      nine cases, criteria used for the diagnosis include 
      architectural atypia (infiltrative margin and/or asymmetry) 
      and/or cytologic atypia (hypercellularity, nuclear 
      pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, mitotic figures, and/or 
      necrosis) [<a href="#ref3"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref3">3</a>]. These features overlap with those of 
      malignant blue nevi and with malignant melanomas in general, 
      and in lesser degree may also be seen in benign cellular 
      blue nevi. Not unexpectedly, there is lack of consensus 
      among experts in the use of this diagnosis [<a href="#ref9"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref9">9</a>]. The behavior 
      of these lesions is generally benign. Local recurrences may 
      occur, and lymph node “metastases” may also be present in 
      regional nodes [<a href="#ref1"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref1">1</a>]. There is debate as to whether these 
      represent nodal nevi or true metastases [<a href="#ref10"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref10">10</a>]. In any event, 
      distant metastasis and death have been rarely if ever been 
      reported in lesions definitively characterized as atypical 
      cellular blue nevi. Nevertheless, there is overlap among 
      cases with this diagnosis, and those diagnosed as malignant 
      blue nevi [<a href="#ref4"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref4">4</a>].</p>
      <p>Malignant blue nevi were also first described by Allen. 
      These tumors resembled blue nevi and were associated with 
      distant metastasis and a high rate of mortality. To 
      establish a diagnosis of malignant blue nevus, it is 
      probably necessary to see evidence of a remnant of cellular 
      blue nevus and/or common blue nevus. It has been suggested 
      that these lesions should be most appropriately termed “blue 
      nevus-like melanoma” [<a href="#ref6"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref6">6</a>]. Although it is reasonable to 
      regard a malignant blue nevus as a form of melanoma, the 
      requirement for evidence of the background lesion would seem 
      to set these lesions apart from other melanomas. In 
      addition, blue nevi and related malignancies tend to have 
      activating mutations in proteins that signal through G-
      protein coupled receptors and are important in early 
      melanoblast proliferation in the dermis (i.e. GnaQ and 
      Gna11). These lesions are less likely to exhibit mutations 
      of the genes involved in the pathogenesis of common nevi or 
      melanomas, such as BRAF, and NRAS or c-Kit [<a href="#ref11"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref11">11</a>].</p>
      <p>The diagnosis of a malignant blue nevus, given the existence 
      of the background blue nevus or cellular blue nevus, is 
      based on three major attributes of malignancy, including 
      first, the presence of focal areas of severe uniform 
      cytologic atypia characterized by nuclear hyperchromatism, 
      irregularity and pleomorphism, often with prominent 
      nucleoli, second, the presence of increased mitotic activity 
      usually including atypical mitotic figures, and third, by 
      the existence of necrosis and/or ulceration. Any of these 
      attributes may be absent or present in slight degree in 
      cases with proven malignant outcomes. This gives rise to 
      uncertainty between the differential diagnoses of atypical 
      cellular blue nevus and malignant blue nevus. In some of 
      these circumstances, a classification of the lesion as a 
      “melanocytic tumor of uncertain malignant potential” is the 
      most prudent course to follow. In such a case, a clear 
      description of the differential diagnostic possibilities 
      should be given, in order that therapy can be planned 
      appropriately [<a href="#ref10"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref12"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref12">12</a>, <a href="#ref13"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref13">13</a>].</p>
      <p>This present case has clearly behaved as a malignant blue 
      nevus, having a background of a banal blue nevus and 
      cellular blue nevus-like areas. The clinical course has been 
      clearly malignant with an initial presentation with lymph 
      node metastases followed by death from disease within two 
      years in this young patient. In a recent study of 26 
      patients with “malignant blue nevus”, the prognosis was 
      dismal and was similar to usual forms of melanoma of similar 
      microstage. Management for these lesions was recommended to 
      be planned according to appropriate melanoma management 
      guidelines [<a href="#ref6"  class="referencelink" data-reference="ref6">6</a>]. </p>
      <p>To characterize this lesion as a cellular blue nevus would 
      clearly have been a significant under-call and might well 
      have led to under-treatment as cellular blue nevi, according 
      to some clinical texts, are wholly benign lesions which do 
      not require reexcision if margins are positive or close. The 
      literature for atypical cellular blue nevi might also give 
      this impression. The more recent literature recognizes the 
      existence of uncertainty in the identification of malignancy 
      in atypical melanocytic lesions of a number of subsets 
      including the cellular vs. atypical vs. malignant blue nevus 
      class of diseases. Although a benign diagnosis was initially 
      favored in this case, a recommendation was given for 
      complete local excision, and recurrence at the local site 
      was not observed in follow-up. It is a mistake in my opinion 
      to render a diagnosis (or a prognosis) that is more 
      definitive than is warranted by the evidence. Patients and 
      clinicians given information as to the range of possible 
      diagnoses can plan therapeutic and life decisions more 
      appropriately than if they are given either false confidence 
      or an inappropriately negative prognosis at the time of 
      initial diagnosis in these difficult cases.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion(s):</h2>
      <p>Overall comment: </p>
      <p>The outcome of this case confirms that lesions with 
      morphology of cellular blue nevi but with mitotic activity 
      must be treated with some circumspection. However, I do not 
      believe that these should be termed malignant melanomas 
      uncritically. Now that this lesion has metastasized 
      systemically of course, it must unfortunately qualify as a 
      malignant blue nevus. As with any malignant melanocytic 
      tumor, the attributes of the primary lesion are not likely 
      to have much influence on the course of the disease now that 
      it has established systemic metastases.</p>
      <p>As events transpired, this lesion resulted in the death of 
      this young patient within two years.</p>
      <p>This lesion did not recur locally following complete 
      excision and therefore must have metastasized systemically 
      prior to its complete removal. This outcome was difficult to 
      predict from histology of the primary tumor, however as a 
      general "rule of thumb" any melanocytic lesion (with the 
      exception of a few well-defined lesion such as Spitz tumors 
      with a low mitotic rate) characterized by a combination of 
      cytologic atypia and dermal mitotic activity should be 
      treated with circumspection, and the possibility of 
      metastatic potential cannot be ruled out. The prognosis, 
      accordingly, should be somewhat guarded in these lesions and 
      they should be regarded as being of uncertain malignant 
      potential.</p>
