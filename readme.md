###Description

Completed through a subcontracting (client-of-a-client) arrangement, this project involved bringing the pages for the end client's annual meeting a little closer to better web practice with HTML5, CSS/SASS, web standards, and unobtrusive JavaScript.

 *(For clarity, I'll refer to my client as **lead developer** and the client's client as **end client**.)*
 
###Starting Point

For a variety of reasons, the lead developer for this project has stuck with *old* HTML: think spacer images, tables as layout, and `<font>` tags. Yikes.

###A Leap Forward
